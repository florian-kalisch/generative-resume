In order for the ingredients to be considered optimal, they must fulfill two conditions: 1) they must cover the minimum values for nutrients specified by the German Nutrition Society and thus be beneficial to health 2) they must be the ones that have the lowest total weight among all possible foods and combinations. For this purpose, I scraped nutritional data and formulated the optimization problem as a linear system of equations, which I solved using the Python framework PuLP. Furthermore, I set up confidence intervals for the weight of the vegetables found, so that weighing the vegetables can be omitted.",
